Frogger a Classic arcade game

To practice Object-Oriented JavaScript this game is built as part of a course in the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program.

*** HOW TO RUN ***

To run the game you must run the index.html file in a browser.

*** HOW TO PLAY ***

The game uses keyboard input via arrows. Players must use the keyboard arrows (up, down, left, right) to navigate the character around the board.

The objective of the game is to always avoid enemy (bug) collisions.

Should the player collide with an enemy, the game will reset the character to the initial position at the bottom-center of the board with a score of 0.

The player wins the game if there are no enemy collisions, allowing the character to reach the blue water at he top of the board.

Once the player successfully reaches the blue water, the score will increase by 1. The player is then put back in it's initial location to try to win again.
